Collaborated in the design of solving course-schedule optimization
problem for the linguistics department at University of Washington by using integer linear programming ([PuLP package](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/)). 
In this project, we translated real life concerns such as departmental requirements and instructor preferences into mathematical constraints to generate an optimized annual course schedule; We implemented the code of this end-to-end system.
