## Introduction
Various works have shown singing destorts tone contours in tonal language and thus hinders perception of the lyrics, especially when the singing pitch is high. This project aims to study **if the pitch change in singing (Happy Birthday) versus speaking is greater in tonal lanaguges (Mandarin) than in non-tonal languages (English).**


## Methodology
- 3 participants: 2 English speakers; 1 Mandarin Speaker
- Song choice: Happy Birthday Song (easy to sing)
- Sing the full song twice; asked to use their real voice
- Read the full lyrics twice 


## Results & Findings
**1.The f₀ difference between speaking and singing does not differ in Mandarin and English.** The Average difference:
- P1 - Eng: 69.4
- P2 - Eng: 38.2
- P3 - Chi: 46.4

But my colleagues are not bad singing :clap::clap:; the contours looks very similar to each other - see below:

**2. Tonal language speakers might be better at maintaining pitch in repeating sentences.**

**3. Speaking is potentially influenced by singing that happens right before.** In other words, it is difficult to read the lyrics without singing :microphone: right after singing the song!
