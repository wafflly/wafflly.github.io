I am a second-year PhD candidate in [Computational Linguistics](https://www.compling.uw.edu/) at University of Washington, advised by Dr. Fei Xia. My research interest is LLM evaluation, Biomedical NLP, and Computational Linguistics in general. Recently, my work has focused on claim verification and particularly on the linguistic constructs within claims that make the verification process more challenging.

As a linguist, I am interested the rules that govern language—syntax, semantic representation, and the language structure of English, Mandarin Chinese, and the Wu dialect. I am particularly interested in how these linguistic principles can be distilled to evaluate, constrain, and improve the behavior of language models.

I also enjoy teaching. Before returning to academia, I led the test preparation department at PalmDrive, where I oversaw teaching, curriculum design, and service delivery.
